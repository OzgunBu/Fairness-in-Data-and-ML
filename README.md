This the first of the Data Fairness project where a data file is read and processed to measure the fairness.

A lot of code here is based on the following blogpost. I will do the pull request when I have a better version

https://blog.godatadriven.com/fairness-in-ml


There are two jupyter notebooks two show demo:

- Product1-demo: 

Input: .csv file

User inputs target field, sensitive attribute, fields to eliminate

Output: accuracy - fairness trade-off

- Product2-demo: 

Input: .csv file for features (train.csv / test.csv)

User inputs target field, sensitive attribute, fields to eliminate

Output: accuracy - fairness trade-off
